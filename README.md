# Intruder Mafia
by DancingEngie

## About
A Trouble In Terrorist Town-inspired map for Intruder. Intended for role-playing and organized groups, though public online play can work if everyone's getting into it.

Players are divided into two groups: civilians and mafia members. Each group must eliminate the other to win. Mafia remembers are always a minority, but they are equipped with sniper rifles. One civilian gets a special role called The Gambler, who also receives a sniper rifle.

An experimental and mostly untested feature is the addition of 'advanced roles' and the White Team - a special, non-affiliated team with their own goals.

## State of Affairs
The role-giving system, activated through a series of hidden Activators, is contrived but functional. The level's layout is mostly done but is filled with dev textures. 

I started working on this map in late February 2019 and ran playtests through early March. From the get-go, I wanted to give the map's source out to the public to build upon the game mode or even to just learn how it works. However, due to various reasons, the biggest one being Intruder's mapmaking package highly limiting nature, I unfortunately won't be updating the map further, or at least very rarely.

## License
Basically, do whatever you want with the level, the concept, the graphic designs etc., but I am not liable for anything you do with it. Credit is really appriciated but not necessary.

Some asset store assets were used, mainly Concrete Texture Pack, the helicopter model and ProBuilder (sorry, #MapMaker community). You can find these in the "Imported" folder in the project itself. These obviously use Unity's Asset Store license.
